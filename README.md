# Working Time-lapse Video Maker

Time-lapse photography is a technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much more spread out than the frequency used to view the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second, but then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. In a similar manner, film can also be played at a much lower rate than at which it was captured, slowing down an otherwise fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography.

Apple's Screen Time did not meet my requirements very well. It is mainly unable to meet the requirements of cross-platform and recording daily behaviors. The project can support up to two cameras as image input sources, and record screen operations to make separate videos, so that you can summarize and adjust the time schedule throughout the day.
